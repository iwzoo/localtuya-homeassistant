# localtuya-homeassistant

Local handling for Tuya Devices under Home-Assistant and Hassio, getting parameters from them (as Power Meters: Voltage, Current, Watt)

# How it works:

   1. Copy switch.py and the other 2 integration/platform files, and pytuya handler folder, to /custom_components/localtuya/ folder, inside /config folder (via Samba for HASSIO).
   
   2. Identify on your Home-Assistant logs (putting your logging into debug mode), the different attributes you want to handle by HA.

   3. Find in the switch.py file that part, and edit it for ID/DPS that is correct for your device.
```
          @property
          def device_state_attributes(self):
            attrs = {}
            try:
                attrs[ATTR_CURRENT] = "{}".format(self._status['dps']['104'])
                attrs[ATTR_CURRENT_CONSUMPTION] = "{}".format(self._status['dps']['105']/10)
                attrs[ATTR_VOLTAGE] = "{}".format(self._status['dps']['106']/10)
            except KeyError:
                pass
            return attrs
```
   NOTE: Original data from the device for Voltage and Watt, includes the first decimal. So if the value is 2203, the correct value is 220,3V. By this reason, this values are divided by 10 ('/10' in the script). While Current is sent in mA (int number, no decimals), so it don't need any conversion factor to be added on the declaration.

   4. Use this declaration on your configuration.yaml file (you need to get the 'device_id' and 'local_key' parameters for your device, as it can be obtained on other tutorials on the web:
```
       switch:
         - platform: localtuya
           host: 192.168.1.251
           local_key: 1234567890abcdef
           device_id: abcdef1234567890abcdef
           update_interval: 20 
           switches: (optional)
             switch1:
             friendly_name: TUYA_LED
             id: 1
           switch2:
             friendly_name: TUYA_SW01
             id: 101
```
   NOTE: if no 'switches' sepcified, it will use the device id for device name. 


   NOTE: (as many switch declared as the device has, take note that: If your device is composed (ex. one switch with a independent led light in it), this led can be declared as a 'switch'. Â¡This Python script does not include RGB handling! (RGB Handling is independent and must be declared as a 'light' custom device, you can search web for examples, but i have not test this).
      
   5. Use this declaration on your configuration.yaml file, for stating sensors that handle its attributes:
```   
       sensor:
         - platform: template
           sensors:
             tuya-sw01_voltage:
               value_template: >-
                 {{ states.switch.tuya-sw01.attributes.voltage }}
               unit_of_measurement: 'V' 
             tuya-sw01_current:
               value_template: >-     
                 {{ states.switch.tuya-sw01.attributes.current }}
               unit_of_measurement: 'mA'      
             tuya-sw01_current_consumption:
               value_template: >-
                 {{ states.switch.tuya-sw01.attributes.current_consumption }}
               unit_of_measurement: 'W' 
```               
   6. If all gone OK (your device's parameters local_key and device_id are correct), your switch is working, so the sensors are working too.
   
   NOTE: You can do as changes as you want in scripts ant/or yaml files. But: You can't declare your "custom_component" as "tuya", tuya is a forbidden word from 0.88 version or so. So if you declare a switch.tuya, the embedded (cloud based) Tuya component will be load instead custom_component one.
   
   NOTE2: tuya-sw01, TUYA-SW01, is the name (friendly name), so you can name it as you want, regarding to change this word every where it appears. Really you can name the sensors not using the name of the original switch. But the recomendation is to do it, so you can know what sensor it is (to be more traceable).

# To-do list:

   Create a (good and precise) sensor (counter) for Energy (kWh) -not just Power, but based on it-. 
      Ideas: Use: https://www.home-assistant.io/components/integration/ and https://www.home-assistant.io/components/utility_meter/
   
   RGB integration (for devices integrating both plug switch, power meter, and led light) 

# Thanks to:

NameLessJedi, for the work tweaking my code to allow using same integration files/folder for different DPS assignment switches. Visit the https://github.com/NameLessJedi/localtuya-homeassistant repository if you can't find a updated (pytuya version) of my code or do need the tweak.

sean6541, for the working (standard) Python Handler for Tuya devices.

some-other-user, i really can't find now, (i will credit/thank him here), who published a partialy Python script that inspired this solution
   
rdelcorro, for last fixes of pytuya module break from HASSIO last updates: no module named 'pytuya' .
